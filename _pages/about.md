## :wave: Welcome to [Curiosity]({{site.baseurl}}) :tm:

My name is **Zeeshan Khan Suri**. I believe in life long learning :mortar_board:, I yearn for knowledge :books: and I seek :eyes: the truth :microscope:. In [Curiosity]({{site.baseurl}}), I plan to document :pencil: my journey :roller_coaster: towards this goal :dart:, for that is what that matters in the end :rocket:. Be open minded :haircut_woman:, humble :speak_no_evil:  and try not to judge :balance_scale: me by my perspective :performing_arts:. Read about [my purpose in life](https://zshn25.github.io/purpose/#my-purpose) to know me better.

## Acknowledgements

This blog is also my self exploration into website building without knowing anything about websites. This learning experience was made possible into a live website thanks to these resources and people.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the static site-generator with [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme with lots of customizations.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting my website for free.
- [Fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/), Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown converter with many other functionalities. (It's great!)
- [Jekyll TOC](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc)
- [Jekyll-Codex](jekyllcodex.org)
- [Dark mode](https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/colours/jekyll/css/fastpages/2020/10/30/hello-dark-mode.html)
