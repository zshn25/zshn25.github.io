# Definitions of state/regime, it’s citizens, a good citizen and a good regime

A state is composite, like any other whole made up of many parts; these are the citizens, who compose it. It is evident, therefore, that we must begin by asking, Who is the citizen, and what is the meaning of the term?

We may say, first, that a citizen is not a citizen because he lives in a certain place, for resident aliens and slaves share in the place; But the citizen is he who shares in the administration of justice, and in offices. **He who has the power to take part in the deliberative or judicial administration of any state is said by us to be a citizens of that state; and, speaking generally, a state is a body of citizens sufficing for the purposes of life.** >Whoever is entitled to participate in an office involving deliberation and decision making is a citizen of the city.

The regime is an arrangement of a city with respect to it’s offices, particularly the ones who has authority over all matters. For, what has authority in a city is everywhere the governing body. And the governing body is the regime. 

Since there are many forms of regimes, there must be many varieties of citizen and especially of citizens who are subjects. There are different kinds of citizens; and he is a citizen in the highest sense who shares in the honours of the state.

A citizen is one who shares in governing and being governed. He differs under different forms of government, but in the best state he is one who is able and willing to be governed and to govern with a view to the life of virtue.

## Who is a good citizen?

Those who care for good government take into consideration virtue and vice in states. Whence it may be further inferred that virtue must be the care of a state which is truly so called.

Citizens differ from one another, but the salvation of the community is the common business of them all. This community is the constitution; the virtue of the citizen must therefore be relative to the constitution of which he is a member.

The same question may also be approached by another road, from a consideration of the best constitution


## Forms of regimes

**Regimes which have a regard to the common interest are constituted in accordance with strict principles of justice, and are therefore true forms**; but those which regard only the interest of the rulers are all defective and perverted forms, for they are despotic, whereas a state is a community of freemen.

The true forms of government, therefore, are those in which the one, or the few, or the many, govern with a view to the common interest; but governments which rule with a view to the private interest, whether of the one or of the few, or of the many, are perversions. For the members of a state, if they are truly citizens, ought to participate in its advantages. 

Of forms of government in which one rules, we call that which regards the common interests, kingship or royalty; that in which more than one, but not many, rule, aristocracy; and it is so called, either because the rulers are the best men, or because they have at heart the best interests of the state and of the citizens. But when the citizens at large administer the state for the common interest, the government is called by the generic name --a constitution. And there is a reason for this use of language. One man or a few may excel in virtue; but as the number increases it becomes more difficult for them to attain pertection in every kind of virtue, though they may in military virtue, for this is found in the masses. Hence in constitutional government the fighting-men have the supreme power, and those who possess arms are the citizens. 

Of the above-mentioned forms, the perversions are as follows: of royalty, tyranny; of aristocracy, oligarchy; of constitutional government, democracy. For tyranny is a kind of monarchy which has in view the interest of the monarch only; oligarchy has in view the interest of the wealthy; democracy, of the needy: none of them the common good of all.

The real difference between democracy and oligarchy is poverty and wealth. Wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, weather they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy and wealth… and freedom are the grounds on which the two classes lay claim to the government.

Kings rule according to law over voluntary subjects, but tyrants over involuntary; and the one are guarded by their fellow-citizens the others are guarded against them.

# The purpose of a state/regime?

Man is by nature a political animal. And therefore, men, even when they do not require one another's help, desire to live together; not but that they are also brought together by their common interests in proportion as they severally attain to any measure of well-being. This is certainly the chief end, both of individuals and of states.

**A state exists for the sake of a good life, and not for the sake of life only**; Nor does a state exist for the sake of alliance and security from injustice, nor yet for the sake of exchange and mutual intercourse; It is manifest therefore that a state is not merely the sharing of a common locality for the purpose of preventing mutual injury and exchanging goods. These are necessary preconditions of a state's existence, yet nevertheless, even if all these conditions are present, that does not therefore make a state, which is a community of families and aggregations of families in well-being, for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life. Such a community can only be established among those who live in the same place and intermarry. Hence arise in cities family connections, brotherhoods, common sacrifices, amusements which draw men together. But these are created by friendship, for **the will to live together is friendship. The end of the state is the good life, and these are the means towards it. And the state is the union of families and villages in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which we mean a happy and honorable life.**

If wealth and freedom are necessary elements, justice and valor are equally so; for without the former qualities a state cannot exist at all, without the latter not well.


# Similarity in states

A question is raised respecting the state, whether a certain act is or is not an act of the state; for example, in the transition from an oligarchy or a tyranny to a democracy. In such cases persons
refuse to fulfill their contracts or any other obligations, on the ground that the tyrant, and not the state, contracted them; they argue that some constitutions are established by force, and not for the sake if the common good.

This question runs up into another: on what principle shall we ever say that the state is the same, Or different? It would be a very superficial view which considered only the place and the inhabitants (for the soil and the population may be separated, and some of the inhabitants may live in one place and some in another). Again, shall we say that while the race of inhabitants, as well as their place of abode, remain the same, the city is also the same, although the citizens are always dying and being born, as we call rivers and fountains the same, although the water is always flowing away and coming again.  Or shall we say that the generations of men, like the rivers, are the same, but that the state changes? **For, since the state is a partnership, and is a partnership of citizens in a constitution, when the form of government changes, and becomes different, then it may be supposed that the state is no longer the same.** And in this manner we speak of every union or composition of elements as different when the form of their composition
alters; And if this is true it is evident that the sameness of the state consists chiefly in the sameness of the constitution, and it may be called or not called by the same name, whether the inhabitants are the same or entirely different. It is quite another question, whether a state ought or ought not to fulfil engagements when the form of government changes.

Our conclusion, then, is that political society exists for the sake of noble actions, and not of mere companionship. Hence they who contribute most to such a society have a greater share in it.

All the partisans of different forms of government speak of a part of justice only.

# Justice in a regime

{% comment %} 
There is also a doubt as to what is to be the
supreme power in the state: Is it the multitude?
Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one best
man? Or a tvrant? Any of these alternatives
seems to involve disagreeable consequences. If
the poor, for example, because they are more in
number, divide among themselves the property
of the rich - is not this unjust? 
Again, when in the first division all has been taken, and the majority divide anew the property of the minority, is it not evident, if this goes on, that they will ruin the state? Yet surely, virtue is not the ruin of those who possess her, nor is justice destructive of a state: and therefore this law of confiscation clearly cannot be just. If it were, all the acts of a tyrant must of necessity be just; for he only coerces other men by superior power.

In all sciences and arts the end is the good, and the greatest good - this is the political science of which the good is justice, in other words, the common interest.

Laws, when good, should be supreme; and that the magistrate or magistrates should regulate those matters only on which the laws are unable to speak with precision owing to the difficulty of any general principle embracing all particulars. But what are good laws? The goodness or
badness, justice or injustice, of laws varies of
necessity with the constitutions of states. This,
however, is clear, that the laws must be
adapted to the constitutions. But if so, true forms of government will of necessity have just laws, and perverted forms of government will have unjust laws.

Magistrates do many things from spite and
partiality. Desire is a wild beast, and passion perverts the minds of rulers, even when they are the best of men. The law is reason unaffected by desire. in seeking for justice men seek for the mean or neutral, for the law is the mean.


What is just or right is to be interpreted in the sense of ‘what is equal’. All men think justice to be a sort of equality. For they admit that justice is a thing and has a relation to persons, and that equals ought to have equality. But there still remains a question: equality or inequality of what?

those who are equal in one thing ought not to have an equal share in all, nor those who are unequal in one thing to have an unequal share in all, it is certain that all forms of government which rest on either of these principles are perversions. All men have a claim in a certain sense, as I have already admitted, but all have not an absolute claim.

 in Nichomechian Ethics Book 7, C7 Aristotle says that all natural “right” is mutable or changeable. By this he means, what is naturally right is revealed not by general propositions, or universal maxims, but the concrete decisions of the community or it’s leaders about what is right or wrong. Natural right is mutable because different kinds of circumstances will require different kinds of decisions.
